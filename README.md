Hello! This repository showcases my past works completed during my python studies. Feel free to connect.

Program content

  Users will be asked to input a number to produce shifted
  ALPHABET as the cipher table. After that, any strings typed
  in will be encrypted.

- ASCII art rocket

  This program will implement a console program
  that draws ASCII art - a rocket.
  The size of rocket is determined by a constant
  defined as SIZE at top of the file.

- DNA sequence

  This program uses string manipulation to
  tackle a real world problem - finding the
  complement strand of a DNA sequence.
  The program provides different DNA sequence as
  a python string that is case-sensitive.

- Hangman

  This program plays hangman game.
  Users see a dashed word, trying to
  correctly figure the un-dashed word out
  by inputting one character each round.

  updated word on console. Players have N_TURNS
  chances to try and win this game.

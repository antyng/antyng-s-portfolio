Hello! This repository showcases my past works completed during my python studies. Feel free to connect.

Program content
- caesar_cipher

  This program demonstrates the idea of caesar cipher.
  Users will be asked to input a number to produce shifted
  ALPHABET as the cipher table. After that, any strings typed
  in will be encrypted.

  File Name: caesar.py

- ASCII art rocket

  This program will implement a console program
  that draws ASCII art - a rocket.
  The size of rocket is determined by a constant
  defined as SIZE at top of the file.

  File Name: rocket.py

- DNA sequence

  This program uses string manipulation to
  tackle a real world problem - finding the
  complement strand of a DNA sequence.
  The program provides different DNA sequence as
  a python string that is case-sensitive.

  File Name: complement.py

- Hangman

  This program plays hangman game.
  Users see a dashed word, trying to
  correctly figure the un-dashed word out
  by inputting one character each round.
  If the user input is correct, show the
  updated word on console. Players have N_TURNS
  chances to try and win this game.

  File Name: hangman.py

- Hailstone sequence

  This program implements a console program that simulates
  the execution of the Hailstone sequence, defined by Douglas
  Hofstadter.

  File Name: hailstone.py

- Prime Checker

  This program asks our user for input and checks if the input is a
  prime number or not. First, ” Welcome to the prime checker” will be printed on Console.
  And the program will continually ask the user to enter an integer 
  that is greater than 1 and checks if it is a prime number.
  The program ends when the user enter the EXIT number.

  File Name: prime_checker.py

- Quadratic Solver

  This program should implement a console program
  that asks 3 inputs (a, b, and c)
  from users to compute the roots of equation:
  ax^2 + bx + c = 0
